This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to undefined variables within conditional statements.  The example shows that simply checking if a variable is set using `isset()` is not sufficient to prevent errors if the variable is subsequently used. This can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors. The solution demonstrates a proper way to handle this situation.
