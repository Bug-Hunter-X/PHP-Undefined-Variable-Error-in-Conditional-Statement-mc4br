This code snippet demonstrates a common issue in PHP where an undefined variable is used within a conditional statement.  The problem arises because the conditional check itself may trigger a notice or warning, but the subsequent use of the undefined variable leads to unexpected behavior or errors.

```php
<?php
if (!isset($variable)) {
    //This would prevent the warning from triggering if the variable is not set.
    //But this is not enough
    echo "Variable is not set";
}

echo $variable; // This line may cause an undefined variable error.
?>
```
